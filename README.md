# Snake

This was initially meant to be a simple recreation of snake made using Java but I started messing with AI and created this.

There is the original player-controlled game mode and an AI mode. The AI mode has 2 deterministic AIs (shortest path and hamiltonian with shortcuts) and a Q-Learning mode.

There are 2 game sizes: 24 by 24 and 100 by 100.
